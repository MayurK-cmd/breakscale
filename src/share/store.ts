/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * Stored share links.
 *
 * The fragment format carries a whole design in the URL, which is what
 * makes a link a complete document that needs nothing to exist. It also
 * means the URL grows with the design, and past about 2000 characters
 * chat apps and mail clients stop carrying it: the designs most worth
 * sharing were the ones a link could not hold.
 *
 * A stored link fixes the length by moving the bytes rather than
 * shrinking them:
 *
 *   https://breakscale.tech/?s=<id>#k=<key>
 *
 * The id names an encrypted blob in the store. The key opens it and
 * rides in the fragment, which the browser never sends anywhere, so the
 * store holds ciphertext it has no way to read. See ./crypto.ts for why
 * that split is the whole design.
 *
 * The length is then fixed whatever the design: about 60 characters,
 * for a three-node sketch and a twenty-node reconstruction alike.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS, SAID PLAINLY. A stored link needs the store to be
 * reachable when it is created and when it is opened, and the old
 * fragment links did not need anything. That is a real loss and it is
 * why the fragment readers are kept: `d1.`, `d2.` and `d3.` links keep
 * opening exactly as they did, offline, forever.
